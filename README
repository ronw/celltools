This package contains a set of standard functional programming tools
that can be used on cell arrays.  It contains implementations of map,
reduce, filter (called cfilter so as not to conflict with the filter()
function in the Signal Processing Toolbox), and lazymap which has the
same semantics as map but uses lazy evaluation.
